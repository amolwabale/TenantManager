You are my senior product UI engineer.

Take the following screen/component code and:
- Upgrade ONLY the UI to industry-grade quality (Cred/Paytm-level polish)
- Do NOT change any business logic, API calls, navigation, or functionality
- Keep the same data flow and props
- Use clean visual hierarchy, sections, spacing, icons, cards, and modern patterns
- Prefer react-native-paper components if already used
- No new dependencies unless explicitly asked
- Output the FINAL code in ONE PIECE, ready to copy-paste
- Make confident UI decisions on my behalf (assume I am not a UI designer)
- Optimize for touch ergonomics and one-hand usage.

Here is the code:
